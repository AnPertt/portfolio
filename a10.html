        <h2>A10: Reflections from the Course</h2>
        <p>Week 7, reflections on the most important learning goals during this course and how they could benefit me in the future </p>
        </br> 
        <p>1.	Whole process of designing a product</p>
        <p>This has been the most valuable aspect as whole from this course, to learn what a digital service design process looks like 
          and what it can hold in it. This will benefit my future career knowing already something that goes into a design sprint, how 
          it is conducted, what is important, what methods are mot commonly used. Having hands on experience in something you wish to do 
          in your career is never a bad thing. Having something to add to your portfolio for further job or internship search is one of the 
          many benefits of this course. Maybe the importance of portfolio in the field could be added to this one too.</p>
        </br>
        <p>2.	Importance of documentation</p>
        <p>One of my key learnings is the importance of documentation during design process, so everything can be revisited or re-evaluated. 
          It is easier to combine facts and progress further with having all the previous steps documented.</p>
        </br>
        <p>3.	Tools for design</p>
        <p>One of my learning goals was to learn and know more of tool used in design processes in digital service and during this course we got 
          to use multiple different ones. Tools that I learnt to use fluently are Figma, Canva, Penpot, Github and Wix. I had previous experience 
          from Wix, Canva and GitHub but other tools where unknown to me. Especially Penpot will prove to be highly beneficial for my future career 
          options since innovating and prototyping is what I aspire to work with in the future. </p>
        </br>
        <p>4.	Goal setting </p>
        <p>To hit a certain goal in a project you really have to set a hard goal that you can build everything else around. During design process 
          having a long-term goal helped to stay focused on the desired end outcome and helped avoiding traying from the original plan.</p>
        </br>
        <p>5.	Understanding problems</p>
        <p>I gained new outlook on how to view problems during the course. Instead of solving them, trying to understand the root and nature of the problem. 
          Because if one only tries to obsessively solve a problem, they might miss crucial points or information and end up not actually even solving the 
          problem but offering users something they didn’t even want in the first place. Taking a lot more viewer kind of approach rather than doer. 
          At least at first. During the course we went through detailed steps on how to understand and handle the problem which helped me greatly to gain 
          different point of view for future work life projects.</p>
        </br>
        <p>6.	Versatility and complexity of human centered design</p>
        <p>The versatility and complexity of making a user-friendly service. During this course in addition to methods we were taught with extra material 
          on Moodle about design principles. This is also something I really was looking forward from this course and had originally in my learning goals. 
          Understanding field principles for future work life purpose to gain knowledge of what it is to be a UXDeigner even before you start at said job.</p>
        </br>
        <p>7.	Experience from UXDesigners</p>
        <p>One of my goals was to have hands on knowledge of what it is to be a UX Designer. During this course we got a lot of hands-on experience from 
          well know designers. A lot of this information will be useful in future career options, which ever it will be. Having even small insight to field 
          is always highly beneficial to understand the nature of the job and it’s industry requirements. </p>
        </br>
        <p>I am more than happy how our team performed during this design task and for the first time in a long time I didn’t have to worry about end 
          deliverables not making it in time. My role in the project ended up mostly being coordinator and lead, who makes sure everyone is on the same 
          page, has same information and knows what tasks they need to perform. Even though our team was very self driven to begin with, a hint of guidance
          didn’t hurt anyone. The workload was contributed evenly, and everyone contributed to many tasks, not just staying in their own task area. Versatility
          was amazing in our team, but everyone did also have their strong suits.</p>
