        <p>Week 4, create our own check list wfor evaluating the work our team has done during Digital Service Design course.</p>

        <h1>1.	Visual message</h1>
        <p>The visual overall look with right colour, typography and layout sends a message just like Simpson is referring to in his video. 
          Your overall visual look of the digital service is going to define your business brand and imago. For example, as a medical company 
          you would want to have something clear, serene and professional looking fonts on your page to raise trust among users, instead of comical, 
          swirly fonts that would give the page much more humorous essence, which would not support business. Same could be applied for images and 
          other layout features within your digital service.</p>

        <h1>2. Error preventing</h1>
        <p>Aiming to prevent errors from occurring before there is even a change for error to occur. Nielsen said that good error messages are important, 
          but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place (Nielsen, January 2024). Digital service needs to be designed 
          in such way that eliminates error-prone conditions or checks for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the 
          action (Nielsen, January 2024). A service is much more user-friendly and convenient to use if there is minimum to no errors at all. Continuous 
          error occurrence can scare users away since the service is not fluent or trustworthy. 
          Occam’s Razor & Pareto Principle support this standard too by stating to select a design with lowest possible complication (Michael Devers 2018). 
          This would also support the importance of error prevention principle within digital service design.</p>

        <h1>3. Conventions</h1>
        <p>Page should follow a good number of conventions as Pásztor stated in his article. Conventions are things in digital design that we are used to that 
          are conventional such as having link blue and arrows allowing you to navigate back, forward, up or down depending on the position of the arrow. 
          A missing convention in where it should be can causes discomfort and misunderstanding from users’ point of view. Enough misunderstandings and user 
          will drop the service. Learnt habits affect the user-friendliness of the digital service or solution hence why it is important to follow the common 
          conventions and see t hat your digital solution supports them. Nielsen states users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, 
          or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions (Nielsen January 2024).</p>

        <h1> 4. Functionality</h1>
        <p>Functionality is big part of any solution. No matter how beautiful the solution is, if it doesn’t work properly or as intended, it is as good as nothing. 
          Can users press the buttons they are intended to press, is the button too small to be pressed with a finger or does the button do the function it’s supposed 
          to perform? All this needs to be taken into consideration when designing. Can users for example reach a certain button with their fingers if they are using 
          service through mobile application. If the functionality doesn’t execute or function poorly, it will affect user satisfaction. For solution to perform it 
          needs to be also functional.</p>

        </br>
        <h1>5. Logic of your solution</h1>
        <p>Your digital service needs to have logic to it. For example, 3 three guiding questions of screen design: when we arrive at a new screen, we are looking 
          for the answer to three questions: Where am I? What can I do here? How can I move forward (Pásztor October 2019)? User should know without having to think 
          any further where they are or on whose service page, they are on to navigate through the solution fluently. Valtakari was talking in his presentation about 
          proximity that supports logic in solutions. With proximity Valtakari means that things that are connected to each other should physically locate in the 
          closeness of each other. This helps navigation and improves user-friendliness greatly. Logic of digital service can also include consistency and standards 
          to it mentioned earlier in principle list number 3.</p>

        <h1>6. Help and Documentation </h1>
        <p>It’s best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to 
          complete their tasks (Nielsen January 2024). System must be self-explanatory enough for user to navigate through it without further introduction. 
          If certain service requires eexplanation, you might want to reconsider weather it’s clear and functional enough or is there a room for betterment. 
          If there is not user help regarding usage of the service, when facing an error or hardship user can easily abandon service.</p>

        <h1>7. Target audience reach</h1>
        <p>Does the service you have designed reach the desired target audience? Digital services might not translate universally to all user groups to it is crucial 
          it translates to your primary user group. Services for elderly people are designed differently compared to services designed for youth or even children. 
          The difference is big, and a mark can be missed if the design does not adhere to these specifications. </p>

        </br>
        <h1>8. Simplicity </h1>
        <p>Simplicity of design highlights the need to remove anything that is unnecessary in digital service design. Anything that might crowd the solution or 
          distract the user from their task within the app. These things can unnecessarily complicate the user experience within the solution. Only the necessary 
          features or design choices should be applied to final design product.</p>
