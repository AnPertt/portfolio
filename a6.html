        <h2>A6: Living with Complexity</h2>
        <p>Week 3, reflections on Don Norman's video </p>
        </br> 
        <p>Don Norman’s video was an interesting piece and had a lot of very good points giving you a completely new look on how 
          to approach digital design and how you should learn digital design. In the beginning of his video Norman questioned the methods 
          we are taught design in modern schools. Rather than exploring and learning together, universities but high weight on analysing and focusing 
          reaching goals alone, thriving for excellency rather than improvement.  </p>
        <p>Norman gave us a question “does our training actually give us the right background to design complex systems?” Designing takes some knowledge 
          on not only technology but people and most importantly the world too. How things work. Understanding that good design is more than just design 
          craft but understanding social systems, laws, profession fields such as medicine for example. I learned that you could be the best possible 
          designer in your craft, but it would mean nothing without further understanding of world and how things work. That there are so much more than 
          just design craft skills that needs to be taken into consideration. </p>
        <p>Another key finding I would take away from Norman’s talk was how necessarily the lack of that knowledge is not a bad thing. Norman was talking 
          a lot about so called “stupid questions”. He stated that stupid questions can be the profound questions that can ground brake the design. If there 
          is no previous knowledge of conditioning to how things work, it can open mind to view matters from different perspective and therefore offer a 
          surprising solution. I learned that most of the times when why something is done the way it is done usually doesn’t have any valid reason behind it, 
          we are just accustomed to do so, no matter if it’s the best possible option available or not. There is always room for betterment if the mind stays open. </p>
        <p>Norman was talking also different ways of thinking. How to make things and designs in information technology more understandable for people we must understand 
          different ways of thinking. Computer scientists think in maths, us designers think through trying and exploring. I learned that to utilize the best possible 
          set of skills we have to be able to understand each other and feature the largest possible set of skills. Teamwork instead of solo work. </p>
        <p>One key finding is going to stick with me. Norman said he applies in his work a method of not even trying to solve the problem. He calls designers problem 
          definers not problem solvers. Usually, the problem presented is not really the actual problem. If you figure out the problem and its nature or quality, you 
          will most likely solve the problem itself without forcing to provide a solution. This will in the future affect my approach on design problems.</p>
        <p>Another interesting point was on the later part of video when Norman returned to university level training of design students. He highlighted yet again 
          the importance of work together, especially with his chess team example. I have to agree with his view on collaboration in learning. It is important to work 
          together to use the best possible collective of knowledge and views and this should be applied more in university work. Ability to join forces and learn from 
          each other than alone. To know how to put the knowledge together for something better.</p>
