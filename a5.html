        <h2>A5: Working as a Digital Designer</h2>
        <p>Week 2, reflections on Félix Meens video </p>
        </br> 
         <p>I found Félix Meens’ video being exactly what I was hoping to gain information from. I started my studies with 
         Software Development and quickly learned the subject didn’t bring me professional enjoyment. After changing my major to 
         Digital Services I feel like I have something to give and learning about possible jobs is what I wanted to acquire and have 
         been trying to acquire for some time, so the video really resonated with my possible future career choices.</p>
        <p>I wish to focus on digital design due to its versatility and art and service based nature. Problem solving is also very high 
          on my list of tasks I enjoy naturally. I have previous education in classic arts and long work history in customer service jobs. 
          I feel like digital design or digital services could merge that. My goal is to focus on user interface design and the betterment of 
          overall user experience with variety of system visuals. </p>
        <p>I have learned that digital designer can be multiple things but that is exactly why I find this field interesting because 
          it’s not limited into small narrow box but rather gives “artistic freedom” to your professional life. Basic work frame stays the 
          same even though the nature of work can vary which I personally have always preferred in my jobs. </p>
        <p>What surprised me was the highlight on soft skills instead of hard skills. I have always thought the demand for hard skills is 
          higher than soft skills. Personally, my stronger side has always been soft skills and I fear even lacking in some aspects on hard skills.
          But I do agree, influencing people is a big part of being a designer, no matter the task or work. People will hire you again if they enjoy 
          working with you so basically being a designer is also selling yourself as a product to employer or project. </p>
