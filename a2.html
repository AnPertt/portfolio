    <h2>A2: W3 CSS Tutorial Reflections</h2>
    <p>Week 1, first task to learning portfolio reflections. </p> 
   </br>
      <p>I am Anni Perttula, a 33-year-old bachelorâ€™s degree undergraduate in Information technology. I study in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences located in Pasila Helsinki, and I am currently starting my last year of studies. The completion of my studies is approximately 55% completed and my goal is to graduate around Christmas 2024.  </p>
   <p>I have my previous experience and knowledge gained from retail, entertainment, wellbeing, and sports. I did a long career in retail, from 2006 to 2018 until I decided to switch fields. From 2014 to 2019 I have run my entertainment small business in which process I got most in touch with digital service design processes. Setting up a business involved continuous betterment of your service and craft. Outside of my common work in retail and my own business I have shallow touch point on focusing solely to digital service design. </p>
   <p>My prior knowledge on subject is based on previous passed courses in our curriculum such as Orientation to Digital Services and Orientation to Software Engineering, known as Introduction to Digital Services and Introduction to Software Engineering in the earlier stages of the program in 2022. In addition to mentioned courses above, I have also completed Digital User Experience course last semester.  </p>
   <p>Digital service design has many tools in use but the most known to myself, based on my previous experience, are interviews, user journeys, storyboarding and prototyping. From program side of tools, I have familiarized myself with Figma before. Any creative programs I believe can be beneficial to digital service design, such as Sketch or Adobe Illustrator. </p>
   <p>Continuing my career in Information technology I am most interested in UX Research and Design, and my personal goal is to do my thesis on UX research subject with focus on cost cutting in long UX processes with AI. I have a very service-oriented mind and I like problem solving especially when it helps individuals or users. My objective for this course is to learn as much as possible of the processes and familiarize myself with the methods. Only possible obstacle between me and my end goal is time versus effort, but luckily first part of this semester is less hectic schedule wise and I can focus on reaching my objectives. </p>
