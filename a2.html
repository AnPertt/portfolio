        <h2>A2: W3 CSS Tutorial Reflections</h2>
        <p>Week 1, the first task to learning portfolio reflections.</p>
        <p>Working with website creation is a subject I have previously explored a couple of times during my studies at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Science. 
        HTML and CSS basics became familiar to me during our first-year classes, especially during the Introduction to Digital Services course held by Kasper Valtakari. 
        During the course, our goal was to build responsive website for a cause of our choosing, completed with visuals, flexboxes, appropriate color schemes completed with W3C HTML and CSS validation.  
        I chose to create a mock-up website for my own small business, 3Fins Diving. 
        Preparation and execution of the project took approximately 7 weeks and the finished product can viewed <a href="https://anpertt.github.io/3FinsDiving/">HERE</a>.</p>
       
        <p>Most of the basic structures of HTML and CSS was familiar to me, and also the reason why, I decided to record my learning portfolio with GitHub instead of other more fluid platforms.
        I had a good base layout for website I generated during introduction course that I have kept, modified and used as base for other projects. The same base I used as a root code for this learning portfolio. 
        Here is a part of HTML code created for this webite that you are currently viewing:</p>
