        <h2>A2: W3 CSS Tutorial Reflections</h2>
        <p>Week 1, the first task to learning portfolio reflections.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Working with website creation is a subject I have previously explored a couple of times during my studies at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Science. 
        HTML and CSS basics became familiar to me during our first-year classes, especially during the Introduction to Digital Services course held by Kasper Valtakari. 
        During the course, our goal was to build responsive website for a cause of our choosing, completed with visuals, flexboxes, appropriate color schemes completed with W3C HTML and CSS validation.  
        I chose to create a mock-up website for my own small business, 3Fins Diving. 
        Preparation and execution of the project took approximately 7 weeks and the finished product can viewed <a href="https://anpertt.github.io/3FinsDiving/">HERE</a>.</p>
       
        <p>Most of the basic structures of HTML and CSS was familiar to me, and also the reason why, I decided to record my learning portfolio with GitHub instead of other more fluid platforms.
        I had a good base layout for website I generated during introduction course that I have kept, modified and used as base for other projects. The same base I used as a root code for this learning portfolio. 
        Here is a part of HTML code created for this webite that you are currently viewing:</p>
       </br>
       <img src="code.jpg" alt="Page HTML code">
       </br>
       </br>
       <p>Below we can view a snippet of this webpages CSS code, more specifically the part that modifies dropdown menu's styles. 
       Color references were modified from last projects and dropdown menu added to serve the usability of this website better. </p>

       </br>
       </br>
       <p>In the tutorial video, which can be viewed behind this <a href="https://youtu.be/PJHBKwbf4Us?si=DEokwgEkD8nIEC_v">LINK</a>, were a lot of good pointers to more efficient website building. During Introduction to Digital Services course one of our main resources 
       was W3 Schools too. Using W3 library for building has become a habbit and when building I use W3 library often to shop for features or refresh memory. The tutorial also
       made me rethink my way of coding, especially HTML. In the tutorial Brad used a lot of classes in HTML coding to combine styling in both HTML and CSS code. He used a lot of
       fast optioned styling like commands red, button or right and left. I have strictly kept all styling in CSS. Brad almost appeared to use CSS as a fine tuning tool to correct
       the styling he didn't quite achieve in HTML code. A approach I will definately try in my next project. I am also going to see if I could refine already existing code from this website to be more efficiently built through class building in HTML. </p>
