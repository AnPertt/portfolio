        <h2>A2: W3 CSS Tutorial Reflections</h2>
        <p>Week 1, the first task to learning portfolio reflections.</p>
        <p>Working with website creation is a subject I have previously explored a couple of times during my studies at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences. 
        HTML and CSS basics became familiar to me during our first-year classes, especially during the Introduction to Digital Services course held by Kasper Valtakari. 
        During the course, our goal was to build our responsive website for an imaginary customer. I chose to make a website for my own entertainment small business, 3Fins Diving. 
        You can view the project <a href="https://anpertt.github.io/3FinsDiving/">HERE</a>.</p>
        <p>Most of the basic structures of html and CSS was familiar to me and also the reason why I decided to record my learning portfolio with GitHub instead of other much easier platforms.
          I had a good base layout for website I generated during introduction course and that I have kept, modified and used as base for other projects. The same base I used as a root code for this learning portfolio too. 
          Here is a part of Html code created for this webite that you are currently viewing:</p>
