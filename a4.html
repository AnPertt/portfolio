        <h2>A4: The Immutable Rules of UX by Jakob Nielsen</h2>
        <p>Week 2, reflections on video by Jakob Nielsen</p>
        </br> 
       <p>Jakob Nielsen’s video "The Immutable Rules of UX" was highly interesting take in the real-world challenges in UX and also, 
         good insider look into rules that almost always apply, no matter what the situation. You can watch the video  <a href="https://youtu.be/OtBeg5eyEHU" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
      <p>UX process is never a straightforward process. Nielsen’s video highlighted how diverse process of UX design actually is. UX, 
        like Nielsen says, revolves around people and people are complex beings therefore designing for people is a complex process. 
        Most of the rules presented, such as test before launch, could be stated as obvious part of the process but surprisingly at 
        times overlooked. This was surprising for me to learn. </p>
      <p>What really spoke to me was Nielsen talking about doing early-stage changes to your design, so you don’t get attached to 
        your solution. It is easier to kill a project or do complete overhaul in the beginning rather than further in the design process 
        when you might have already developed emotional attachments to your design. Bringing new viable ideas to the table and killing old 
        ones gets harder, even though it would be for the better of the project. This is a guideline I will be following in my future projects, 
        and I find it highly beneficial for any project development, UX or not.</p>
      <p>What also I found interesting was Nielsen talking about user expectations versus UX design developments along the years. Nielsen talked 
        how we are in this loop of constantly catching up to user expectations. We are not gradually getting worse; we are trying to keep up with 
        user learning from more and more advanced programs. User expectations develop as we keep feeding them more and more efficient solutions. 
        Users gets familiarized with the high efficiency level and expect that from the future programs too. So user and UX design both walk hand 
        in hand evolving together, meaning that UX design has to keep one step forward of users when they are designing.</p>
