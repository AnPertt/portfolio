        <h2>A8: Reflections on Journey Mapping</h2>
        <p>Week 4, reflections on Journey Mapping task </p>
        </br> 
         <p>I have learned that Customer Journey Map can be extremely useful tool when designing and especially when designing human-centered. 
           I have learned that to produce a good viable product you have to design from user perspective. </p>
        <p>One of the biggest noticeable values in my experience when using Customer Journey Map as a tool has to be ability to design and build with 
          empathy. Customer Journey Map is a useful way of putting yourself into customers shoes and predict possible falls or mishaps. What would they 
          be feeling and how could I help myself to understand their behalf? Understanding user needs, emotions and motivations better to fill possible 
          gaps in your design. It not only benefits from that aspect, but it makes your design also “care” about the user making it more meaningful to the 
          user in this way.</p>
        <p>The touchpoints were very helpful in Journey Maps. It makes it easier to divide one interaction into smaller actions and focus on them individually. 
          With my team we generated journeys very organically, not planning the whole interaction as one but rather going step by step. After certain action 
          what would the user do next and why? What drives them to take certain actions?</p>
        <p>I felt like Journey Maps also validate user experiences of their journeys with the project. even though as a creator of imaginary reactions and 
          interactions it is sometimes hard to stay subjective and not mix your own views and motives with the mapping. I have learned that it is easier to design
          when you have an example person who you are designing for. It makes it much easier to focus on human-centered designing compared to when you don’t have 
          an example of possible primary user. I found myself coming up with more detailed and personalized solutions than without example user.
          Even though, the humans are never as straight forward as our models might make them seem. I believe user actions and motives are much more complicated 
          than what we can generate but at least we can somewhat closely mimic them. </p>
        <p>In the future I would create possible primary users’ profiles first and then generate multiple different Journey Maps for each user. 
          I feel like the more Journey Maps you have the better picture or better medium of possible interactions you would get. </p>
