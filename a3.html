        <h2>A3: Building Team Web Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Week 1, reflections on building a Team Web Portfolio</p>
        </br> 
        <p>For this project we have formed a four-member team that consists of Natàlia Avellà, Neea Ahonen, Vera Mai and me, Anni Perttula. 
          Our team name for this project is PixelPioneers. Our first task as a team was to choose our platform for creating our Team Web Portfolio for 
          the Digital Service Design course. Most of the pioneers had experience in multiple different platforms but we ended up choosing online webpage 
          building platform called Wix as our tool for this project.  On Wix it would be fast and efficient enough to document our project process and key 
          findings. Team agreed on unison Wix being flexible platform that will let us concentrate more on the quality of our research. We had previous experience 
          in using WIX as webpage creation tool within our team which also affected our decision making on platform. You can access our Team Portfolio webpage 
          <a href="https://bgz904.wixsite.com/my-site-3" target="_blank">HERE</a> for a closer look on our project progress.</p>

        <p>We completed our first week's task of creating the page and adding welcome and team members feature rather fast. After dividing tasks for first week each team member was able to work on the project 
        according to their own availability. Common deadline was set to match with given submission deadlines on Moodle. This made first week of tasks highly efficient and workload was spread evenly. 
        This way of working has proven to work for our team and we plan to execute same working habit on our next task. For further progress we are going to need a task manager or team moderator who is 
        responsible for overall deadlines and monitoring workload.</p>
