        <h2>A3: Building Team Web Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Week 1, reflections on building a Team Web Portfolio</p>
        </br> 
        <p>Our team, PixelPioneers, chose Wix as our platform for creating Team Portfolio and to document our porject process and findings. Whole team agreed on Wix being 
        flexible enough platform that will let us concentrate more on the quality of our research. Our team had previous experience in using WIX as webpage creation tool which also
        affected our decision on platform. You can access our Team Portfolio webpage <a href="https://bgz904.wixsite.com/my-site-3" target="_blank">HERE</a> for a closer look on our project progress.</p>
        <p>Wix allows multiple page editors simultaneosly, so working online, independently or distant, is possible and a very crucial feature for our team. Any of the team members can edit Team Portfolio
        anytime, anywhere. Wix is an easy to use online tool that doesn't require coding, unless you want to specifically customizey a certain block. Wix operates based on templates
        widgets, blocks and ready-made gadgets that can be used to create your own customizable website. Using Wix platform is free and it can be connected to your already existing domains. Wix has a very user friendly 
        layout that requires minimal effort to master.</p>

        <p>We completed our first week's task of creating the page and adding welcome and team members feature rather fast. After dividing tasks for first week each team member was able to work on the project 
        according to their own availability. Common deadline was set to match with given submission deadlines on Moodle. This made first week of tasks highly efficient and workload was spread evenly. 
        This way of working has proven to work for our team and we plan to execute same working habit on our next task. For further progress we are going to need a task manager or team moderator who is 
        responsible for overall deadlines and monitoring workload.</p>
